# Androidomata

Androidomata is an android application used to visualize the working on automata.
The automata works for both definite automata and indefinite automata the automata is made to work for
2 , 3 and 4 can be durther extended but that'll increase the heaviness the app so 2,3 and 4 are kept.
Step1:

The user is prompted to input the number of states are to be present in the automata 2,3, or 4.
Click Submit button

Step 2:

Now user is to decided which one is the primary or the starting state of the automata based on this the automata.

step 3:
The user selecst the final or accepted state where regular expression created by the user is satisfied thus this application also acts as an regular expression checker.

Step 4:
The user decides the number of inputs each state will have it's generally ket two.

step 5:
The user input mappings of each input state to output state for different possible functions.

step 6:
Now the user enters the interatcive session where user can continously provide the input to the automata and the change in the state can be viewed by the focus of the button whenever an accepted state is reached then the accpeted checkbox gets checked.
